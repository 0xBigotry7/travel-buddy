# GitHub Usage Guide

- Only push to GitHub when explicitly requested.
- Never push untested or failing code to GitHub.
- Always keep `.gitignore` up to date to avoid committing sensitive or unnecessary files.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages for all changes.
- Review the status file and all relevant rules before pushing.
